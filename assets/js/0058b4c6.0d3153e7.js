While SCP is a simple, non-interactive command line tool, it is often a more suitable choice when setting up unattended file transfers using scripts. Alternatively, SFTP is an interactive tool which offers features like remote file listing, copying, deleting, directory creation, etc.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"slurm-cluster/tutorial/install-software":{"id":"slurm-cluster/tutorial/install-software","title":"Software Installation","description":"In default situation, you cannot install software via sudo as normal user are not authorized.
