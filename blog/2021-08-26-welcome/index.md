Started from 2018, USBC Maintenance Group provides technical support for UIC-STAT servers. In 2020, it successfully built the first computing cluster USBC, and over 100 researchers and students from department of statistics and data science using this cluster to conduct their research and projects.


The group are now focussing on these five key areas:

* high-performance computing
* bio-informatic analysis
* AI-oriented computing
* Computing platform DevOps (Frontend and Backend Development)
* Distributed storage platform DevOps
