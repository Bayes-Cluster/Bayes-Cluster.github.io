# Basic

Containerisation  is a method of packaging software so that it can run consistently across different computing environments. It allows developers to create, deploy, and run applications in isolated environments called containers. These containers include everything needed to run the application, such as code, runtime, libraries, and dependencies. 

For the high-performance computing (HPC) community, containerisation is particularly useful as it enables the deployment of applications across various systems without worrying about the configuration of the underlying infrastructure, which also helps cloud development's portability and scalability.

Based on the concept of Containerisation and Cloud Development Environment(CDE), we announced the iteration of the cloud-native HPC platform, Chebyshev, in 2025. Between 2025 and 2026, we will gradually migrate the existing SLURM-based HPC platform to the Chebyshev platform, which will provide a more flexible and efficient environment for running the computing workloads. For more information about Chebyshev, please refer to the [Iteration to Chebyshev](../../blog/chebyshev) blog post.
